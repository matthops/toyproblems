//A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

const isSquare = n => (Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n)) ? true : false);

// In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

  let numbersArr = numbers.split(' ');
  return `${Math.max.apply(null, numbersArr)} ${Math.min.apply(
    null,
    numbersArr
  )}`;

// Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
// We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.
// The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

    for (var i = 0; i <= vowels.length; i++) {
      vowels[i] === letter ? vowelsCount++ : null;

  });

  return vowelsCount;
}

// Trolls are attacking your comment section!
// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
